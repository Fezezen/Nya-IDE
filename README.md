# Nya++ IDE 

Nya++ is a code editor I wrote in C++ for fun.

Nya++ isn't really meant for actual use, instead it's meant just to challenge my skills

Nya++ can load cpp files from its local directory, save the current document to the local directory, edit cpp files, compile and run C++ code. Nya++ also features my own special syntax for special file cases.

## Special file info syntax

//@ is the prefix for all (currently only one) special cases

//@filename [filename] > will set the file's name when saved

## Binds and shortcuts

Nya++ features various intuitive shortcuts and keybinds for various actions within the editor.

Of course you can use the arrow keys to navigate the columns and rows of your code, the End key to skip to the end of a line, Home to skip to the front of a line, Delete to delete characters behind the cursor, and backspace to delete characters infront of the cursor. Aswell as enter starting a new line.

F5 when editing will compile and run your code
F5 when running code will return you to the editor

Ctrl + S will save your file
Ctrl + O will prompt you to open a file

## Highlightind and text colour

Nya++ also features highlighting and text colours depending on the prefix and word
